#CV organizer for a school project#
This website was made as part of a course in Backend Webdevelopment. The purpose of this webbsite is to
handle data from an independent API and with the help of CRUD and Fetch API be able to read, create, and
delete data from the API database. It is designed as a CV where you can read a persons work experience,
but you can also add new experiences to it and delete old ones.
The database manager used is SQLite, which is a fast and easy to use DBM which stores the whole database
as a single .db file.

Update: The database used is now a MongoDB database but the site's functionality and code is virtually the same
