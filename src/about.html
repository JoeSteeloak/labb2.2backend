            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This website was made as part of a course in Backend Webdevelopment. The purpose of this webbsite is to
                handle data from an independent API and with the help of <strong>CRUD</strong> and <strong>Fetch API</strong> be able to read, create, and
                delete data from the API database. It is designed as a CV where you can read a persons work experience,
                but you can also add new experiences to it and delete old ones.</p>
            <h2>Database</h2>
            <p>The database manager used is <strong>MongoDB</strong>, a NoSQL database.</p>
            <h2>My own conclusions</h2>
            <p>After struggling with consuming API's in a previous course it was a real eye opener to make your own and
                not as hard as it might seem. It also helped me understand things I found hard or complicated in the
                previous assignment. One thing I would do differently next time is to make this website server-based as
                it makes POST a lot easier to deal with when you create forms.</p>
